# Random Question Generator

- Questions will be randomly chosen on page reload.
- <ins>Built this mostly for personal use</ins>
- Text area does nothing and it's only to support the user in cementing his thought process.
- It won't give you a positive or negative feedback when typing on the text area, as I said it does nothing
- Questions are a combination of questions from other repositories and other youtube videos.
- **I have literally zero experience, I DO NOT KNOW how current frontend interviews are structured and what other random questions they'll ask**
- *also yeah, little to no styling. Too lazy to make it pretty for something so barebone*
